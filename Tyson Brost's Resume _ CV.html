  <li>Worked closely with the company director to aggregate and collect data from across various departments within the company.

I further used a mixture of forecasting techniques to predict growth for the following year by product based on the company’s and each product’s growth patterns over the past 3 years. I then used these values to predict sales by month for each product within a dynamic google sheets (preffered platform of company) allowing the company director to edit certain assumptions made within the calculations being made.</li>
